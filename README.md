# DMX 512 is?

DMX (Extended Demultiplexer for practical purposes Multiple Digital X)

It is an electronic protocol used in lighting control of the light show, enabling communication between control equipment lights
Powered by USITT Engineering Commission, the standard began in 1986, with subsequent revisions in 1990 that gave way to USITT DMX512 / 1990. THIS took control of the standard in 1998 and began the review process.

DMX appears as the solution to the problem of incompatibility that existed between brands by using proprietary protocols, which forced them to take control of management for each brand of lights to be had.

DMX was originally intended for use in link controllers and dimmers from different manufacturers, a protocol that would be used as a last resort after trying other methods more in property, not GNU. However, it soon became the preferred protocol not only to link controllers and dimmers, but also to control lighting equipment as scanners and moving heads, and special effects devices such as smoke machines. As DMX512 is a transmission system unreliable data should not be used to control Pyrotechnics, for this task they are sometimes used MIDI controllers
